# About the App

A Pathfinding Visualizer App built with React JS, which visualizes Dijkstra's algorithm (pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path)

With this interactive app, you can try to create 2 random coordinates on a grid, and with a click of a button, find the shortest path to that two points.
